Identification has 3 classes.
The first one is PatientIdentifier which matches the input(patientID) with ids from the hospital's database, returns the match and reports any discrepancies to IdentityManager.
IdentityManager collects the discrepancies. It also fixes them and validates them after that and corrects mismatches by releasing the data to the right patient.
The last one is PatientRecord which keeps a collection of medical records. It receives patient data from the database and updates it with new information.
